# gmod-discord-integration python 3.8
This is a little integration project for my gmod server.
Barely I've placed flask framework and my own discord bot together.
Flask is used for comfortable handling of http requests from gmod, gmod posts message from its chat and gets messages from discord chat.

Before start you need to configurate the integration with your own discord token, bot and chat ids. 
Ill add bot and chat automatical handling later.

The integration is being lauchned in that way:
python main.py
